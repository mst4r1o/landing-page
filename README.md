This website is a for fun webpage to feature my cat and badmouth him as he is cute but also a bastard at times, as all cats are. It mimics the layout given by The Odin Project and I tried my best to make it look like what they showed while adding in my own content to make it more fun and interactive for me. Though it is still missing a lot in the field of compatibility with other devices or screen size, I would say it works pretty well in a full screen window and even when it is sized down a bit.

Potato is a cat in the upcoming cat elections. This page features his qualities and why he should be the next president of cats. This is only a fraction of what goes on in the great brain of Potato, the crowd-favourite ruler. Enjoy Potato.
